# My Code Wars Solutions

[Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/J4C9eA) is a website with coding challenges, called katas, that allow you to focus on improving your coding skills and technique. Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank(8 Kyu being a Beginner level and 8 Dan being a Master level), based on its subject area and difficulty. You can find out more about Codewars [here](https://www.codewars.com/about).

This repo contains all of my kata solutions. They may not be the best, most elegant, or fastest, however, all answers will be correct. You can check out my codewars profile [here](http://www.codewars.com/users/Belax8) or view my stats [here](http://codepen.io/Belax8/full/WxQmmX/).
